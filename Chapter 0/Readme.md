# Work FLOW 

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to initialize your repository and set up your React app with Parcel bundler.

### 1. Initialize NPM

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install React and React DOM

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

### 3. Install Parcel

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel
```

### 4. Ignite Your App with Parcel

Create your React app entry point (e.g., `index.js`) and your HTML template (e.g., `index.html`), then use Parcel to bundle them.

### 5. Add Scripts for Start and Build

Update your `package.json` to include scripts for starting the development server and building for production.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "parcel index.html",
  "build": "parcel build index.html"
}
```

### 6. Add .gitignore File

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and any other files or directories that shouldn't be committed to Git.

Example `.gitignore`:

```plaintext
node_modules/
dist/
```

### 7. Build Production Version

To build a production version of your code, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

# Theory 


1. **NPM**:
   - NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, manage, and share packages of code (primarily JavaScript) to reuse in their projects. NPM is also used for managing project dependencies and executing scripts.

2. **Parcel/Webpack**:
   - Parcel and Webpack are both popular bundlers in the JavaScript ecosystem. They are used to bundle various modules, assets, and resources of a web application into a single file or a few files that can be efficiently served to the client browser. Bundlers like Parcel and Webpack help optimize and manage dependencies, enable code splitting, and provide features like hot module replacement.

3. **.parcel-cache**:
   - `.parcel-cache` is a directory generated by Parcel bundler to store cached data for faster rebuilds. It contains compiled and processed files to avoid redundant work during subsequent builds.

4. **npx**:
   - `npx` is a package runner tool that comes with NPM. It allows executing binaries from packages without needing to install them globally. `npx` runs the command directly from the local `node_modules` directory or installs the package temporarily if it's not installed locally.

5. **Dependencies vs devDependencies**:
   - `dependencies` are packages required for the application to run in production, while `devDependencies` are packages needed for development and testing purposes. `dependencies` are typically essential for the application's functionality, while `devDependencies` include tools like testing frameworks, compilers, or bundlers.

6. **Tree Shaking**:
   - Tree shaking is a technique used by bundlers like Webpack and Parcel to eliminate dead or unused code from the final bundle. It works by analyzing the code and only including the parts that are actually used, thereby reducing the size of the bundle and improving performance.

7. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**:
   - Hot Module Replacement is a feature that allows developers to replace modules in a running application without a full reload. It speeds up development by preserving the application state while applying changes to the code. It's often used in conjunction with development servers to provide a seamless development experience.

8. **Favorite Parcel Superpowers**:
   - **Zero Configuration**: Parcel requires no configuration out of the box, making it easy to set up and use.
   - **Automatic Asset Handling**: Parcel automatically handles various asset types like CSS, images, and fonts without needing explicit configuration.
   - **Built-in Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Parcel supports HMR by default, enabling fast development iteration cycles.

9. **.gitignore**:
   - `.gitignore` is a file used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It's used to prevent files like build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive data from being tracked in version control. Examples of what to include in `.gitignore` are `node_modules/`, `.parcel-cache/`, and `dist/`.

10. **package.json vs package-lock.json**:
    - `package.json` is a manifest file containing metadata and configuration for a Node.js project, including dependencies and scripts. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated by NPM and ensures deterministic dependency resolution by locking down the version of each installed package.

11. **Avoid modifying `package-lock.json`**:
    - Modifying `package-lock.json` directly is not recommended because it could lead to dependency conflicts or inconsistencies between environments. It's best to let NPM handle the generation and management of `package-lock.json`.

12. **node_modules**:
    - `node_modules` is a directory where NPM installs project dependencies. It contains all the packages required for the project to run. It's generally not recommended to push `node_modules` to Git as it can be regenerated using `npm install`.

13. **dist folder**:
    - `dist` stands for distribution and is a directory commonly used to store the output of a build process. It typically contains the bundled, optimized, and minified files ready for deployment to a production environment.

14. **Browserslist**:
    - Browserslist is a configuration file or query used by tools like Autoprefixer, Babel, and others to determine which browsers to support. It allows developers to define a list of target browsers based on specific criteria like usage statistics, versions, or custom queries.
